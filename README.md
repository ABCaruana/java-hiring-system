# Java hiring system

The java hiring system is a college project to present what i have learned about java in an interactive way.

this is a system split in to two parts, the applicant system and the staff system

## Applicant system

The applicant system is what a theoretical applicant would use to provide information about themselves to the employers. This includes basic info such as name, date of birth, country of residence etc.

There will also be an image upload feature so that "employers" can view a picture of the applicant, as well as generic hiring forms such as "why do you want this job?" and "what makes you suitable for this job" etc.

## Staff system

This is the more in-depth part of the project. In this interface, employers will be able to see a whole list of applicants from one ui, which includes:

1. An image of the applicant
2. their age (calculated by the date of birth)
3. their name
4. their gender

Clicking on an individual user will open up all information on the database about them, along with other options

1. hire/accept applicant
2. reject applicant

Another menu will seperate these two systems so that the user can choose between two options, the staff system should be password protected in some way.

## Skills presented in this project

- code layout
  - the two different systems will be separated to remove confusion
- using libraries
  - I will need to import libraries to get the UI working, as well as database connections, at a minimum.
- Use of a GUI
  - The JavaFX library will be used, along with the intelliJ scene builder
- casting
- selection
  - updating the database dependant on whether the user has pressed specific buttons
- iteration
  - iterating through all applicants in the staff system to construct a user interface
- naming standards
  - seen across all methods, variables, classes etc.
- commenting
  - seen throughout the code
- classes
  - all applicants will be instanciated to get/set data easier
- methods
  - used throughout the program to manipulate data/forms etc
- utilising data from a database.
  - as suggested, the data will run from a local MySQL database
- File handling
  - images uploaded to the app will be saved to the filesystem, named and a reference to them will be made in the database

## Methodology

For this project i will be using the waterfall methodology. To make sure i keep everything on track i will be using microsoft project to create a gantt chart
